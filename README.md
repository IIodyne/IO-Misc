# IO-Misc
A set of miscellaneous configs.

***IO-AstroidRemover.cfg*** removes all asteroids from spawning. This is useful (and often necessary) for users of ***Principia*** as it greatly improves performance due to far fewer vessels that require calculations.

***IO-HideStarConics.cfg*** hides the conic patch paths of any star (specifically any celestial body that shares the Sun's template). This may be preferred in most interstellar star/planet packs.

***IO-ShowSOIs.cfg*** enables the visualization of spheres of influence for all celestial bodies.

***IO-Asteroids-Stock.cfg*** adds asteroids around Duna and Dres.
